## How CSS Works?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), Cascading refers to the way styles are applied to HTML elements.

There are three different styles of adding CSS, Inline, Internal and External, they are used to define the presentation of HTML elements. Cascading means CSS determine the priority of conflicting styles from these different sources using the cascade, which considers specificity and the other of importance.

1. Inline
```
<html style="background: blue">
</html>
```
As the name suggests, it goes into the same line as a particular HTML element, as the code shows above, it goes into the opening tag of the HTML. `background: blue` This part is the CSS code, the first part of it is the property that you want to change, here it's the `background`, the second part is the value of that property you want to set it to, here it sets the background to `blue`.

Inline elements are really useful for adding CSS style to just a single element or specific sections.

2. Internal



3. External
