```c
#include <iostream> // iostream is a library provides functionality for input and output. This means including the input/output stream library.

int main() { // Main function, the entry point of the program.
    std::cout << "Hello Fanfan!" << std::endl; // "std::cout" is an object of the "std::ostream" class, which is used to output data to the console. "<<" operator is the insertion operator, and it's used to insert data into the "std::cout" object, in this case, "Hello Fanfan" is being inserted. "<< std::endl" is used to insert a newline like "\n", it moves the cursor to the next line after printing "Hello Fanfan!".
    return 0; // In C++, the "main" function must return an integer value indicating the exit status of the program. Typically, returning 0 indicates successful program execution, while returning a non-zero value indicates an error.
