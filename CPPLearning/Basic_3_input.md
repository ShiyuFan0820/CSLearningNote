# Input

In C++, user input can be taken by using the `cin`, short for `character input`, which is a part of the `iostream` library.

**How to take input**

1. First, include the `iostream` header, which is necessary for input and output operations.
2. Write the main function which is the entry point of the C++ program, this is where the code will be written to take user input.
3. Use `cin` to take input from the user, `>>` operator is used to extract the data from the input stream.

**Example**

This is a simple example of asking the user's name and age.
```c
