# Four Principles in Object-Oriented Programming

There are four principles in Object-Oriented programming, they are Inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation and Polymorphism.

## Inheritance

Inheitance is a fundamental concept in OOP, it allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behavior (attributes and methods) from another class (supclass or base class). Inheritance enables code reuse and extension of functionality.

## Abstraction

Abstraction allows to hide the implementation details, developers can focus on designing clear and concise interfaces, making the system easier to unserstand and maintain.

From creating abstract class and methods, it serves as blueprints for other classes and are used to define a common interface for a group of related subclasses. By defining an abstract class, developers can establish a common structure and interface for a group of related classes.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation allows the class to control the access to its member variables and methods, preventing direct modification from outside the class, it helps hide the implementation in the class from the external world, only the necessary information can be accessed through some methods or well-defined interfaces.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows instances of different classes can have same method name but with different behaviours, this is achieved through subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its supclass and multiple methods with the same name exist in different classes.
