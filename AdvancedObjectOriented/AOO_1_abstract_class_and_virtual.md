# Abstract Class and Virtual

## What is Abstract Class?

An abstract class is a class that can't be instantiated on its own (This means an instance can not be created directly from the abstract class itself). This is becuase an abstract class often contains at least one or more abstract methods.

An abstract method in an abstract class is a method that is declared but does not contain an implementation (i.e., it has no code inside this method). This means that the abstract method or the abstract class self is incomplete, so it can not create an instance directly.

To create an instance of an abstract class, a subclass should be created, and complete implementations for all abstract methods defined in the abstract class.
