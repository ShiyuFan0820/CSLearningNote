# Dijkstra

Dijkstra is an algorithm which commonly used to find the shortest path in a graph, it is a single source shortest path algorithm for graphs with non-negative edge weights. 

Single source means at the beginning of the algorithm, a single starting node in a graph should be specified, when execute the algorithm, Dijkstra can find the shortest path between that starting node and all other nodes in the graph.

## Graph

A graph is a data structure that consists of a set of vertices (also called nodes) and a set of edges that connect pairs of vertices. A weighted graph is a graph has weighted edges meaning each edge has a numerical weight or cost associated with it, and can represent the distance between two vertices.
