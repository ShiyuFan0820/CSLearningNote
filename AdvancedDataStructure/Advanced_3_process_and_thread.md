## Process

If there is a executable program which is ready to execute, when the program is executing in the operating system, we call the program as a process, so a process can be thought of as a program in execution, a single program can have many processes associated with it.

## Thread

Thread is the unit of execution within a process, a process has at least one thread and also can have mutiple thread.
