# Breadth First and Depth First Search

## Depth First Search

Depth first search (DFS) is a traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## Breadth First Search

Breadth first search (BFS) is a traversal algorithm that explores all nodes at the current depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
