# Breadth First and Depth First Search

Breadth first and depth first search are graph traversal methods used to traverse or visit all the vertices (nodes) in a graph, a graph is a data structure that consists of a set of vertices (also called nodes) and a set of edges that connect pairs of vertices.

## Depth First Search

Depth first search (DFS) is a traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## Breadth First Search

Breadth first search (BFS) is a traversal algorithm that explores all nodes at the current depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
