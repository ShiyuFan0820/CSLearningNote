# Dijkstra

Dijkstra is an algorithm which commonly used to find the shortest path in a graph, it is particularly useful in scenarios where the graph has weighted edges.

## Graph

A graph is a data structure that consists of a set of vertices (also called nodes) and a set of edges that connect pairs of vertices. A weighted graph is a graph has weighted edges meaning each edge has a numerical weight or cost associated with it, and can represent the distance between two vertices.
