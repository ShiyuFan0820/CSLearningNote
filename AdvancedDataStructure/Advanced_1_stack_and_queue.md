## Introduction of Stack Data Structure

Stack data structure and memory stack which we have learned previously are related concept but operate at different levels. 

Memory stack is a memory area used for storing function call frames and local variables, when the function returns, the frames will be popped out of the stack, it follows the rule of LIFO (Last in first out), these operations are managed and implemented by the operating system and hardware, programmers usually don't interact with the memory stack in the code.

Stack data structure is a linear data structure with the primary operations of push and pop, it also follow the rule of LIFO (Last in first out), insertion and deletion can only be performed at the end, also called at the top of the stack. Just like we have a stack of plates, we always put new plates on top, and when we take plates, we also start at the top.
