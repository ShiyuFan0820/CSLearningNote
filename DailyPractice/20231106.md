# If Statement

Excercise:If the holiday name is Valentine's Day,print "Buy roses!" and "Watch a movie!"
If the holiday name is Christmas,print "Have a nice meal!".If the holiday name is Brithday,print "Make a cake!".Others,print "Everyday is holiday!"

```py
holiday name = "Mid-Autume Festival"
if holiday name == "Valentine's Day":
    print("Buy roses!","Watch a movie!")
elif holiday name == "Christmas":
    print("Have a nice meal!")
elif holiday name == "Brithday":
    print("Make a cake!")
else:
    print("Everyday is holiday!")
```

The outcome is:

```py
ERROR!
File "<string>", line 1
    holiday name = "Mid-Autume Festival"
            ^^^^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

_**Error Anlysis:**_

When naming a variable in Python, you need to follow two rules:  

1. Variable names consist of English letters, underscores or numbers, and the first character must be English letters or underscores.  
2. Variable names cannot be Python keywords.

Variables can only contain English letters (both upper and lower case), underscores, or numbers, and no other characters (such as spaces, %, -, *,/, etc.) than these three, because all other characters are already used by Python as operators.

For the second principle, Python keywords refer to Python's own names that are "already in use" and therefore cannot be used when naming variables (since Python already takes them, we cannot use them).

_**Correction:**_

```py
holiday_name = "Mid-Autume Festival"
if holiday_name == "Valentine's Day":
    print("Buy roses!","Watch a movie!")
elif holiday_name == "Christmas":
    print("Have a nice meal!")
elif holiday_name == "Brithday":
    print("Make a cake!")
else:
    print("Everyday is holiday!")
```

_**The out come is:**_
```py
Everyday is holiday!
```
