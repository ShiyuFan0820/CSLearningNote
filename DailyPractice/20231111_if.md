# If Statement

**Exercise 1 : Define a variable of the type of number, the number can be arbitrary, based on the input statement to enter the guessed number, through the combination of if and multiple elif, to determine whether the guessed number is the given number.**

The codes are:

```py
num = 7
guess_num = int(input("Please inster a number:"))
if guess_num == num:
    print("You are right!")
elif guess_num = int(input("You are wrong,guess again:")) == num:
    print("You are right!")
elif guess_num = int(input("You are wrong,you can guess one last time:")) == num:
    print("You are right!")
else:
    print(f"Sorry,none of you answers are right,the right number is:{num}")
```

Run the codes:

```py
    elif guess_num = int(input("You are wrong,guess again:")) == num:
         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Maybe you meant '==' or ':=' instead of '='?
```

_**Error Analysis:**_

 _In the elif statement, there are some things mixed up in the conditional judgment and input statement. You should receive the user's input first, and then use that input in a conditional judgment_
 
_**Correction:**_

_The codes are:_

```py
num = 7
if int(input("Guess a number:")) == num:
    print("You are right!")
elif int(input("You are wrong,guess again:")) == num:
    print("You are right!")
elif int(input("You are wrong,guess one last time:")) == num:
    print("You are right!")
else:
    print(f"You are wrong!The correct number is {num}!")
```

_Run the codes:_

```py
Guess a number:1
You are wrong,guess again:2
You are wrong,guess one last time:3
You are wrong!The correct number is 7!
```

**Exercise 2 : Randomly generate a number in the range of 1-10, there are 3 chances to guess the number, through 3 layers of nested judgment to achieve, each guess to indicate whether it is greater or smaller.**

The codes are:

```py
import random
num = random.randint(1,10)
guess_num = int(input("Input the number you guessed："))
if guess_num == num:
    print("Great！")
else:
    if guess_num > num:
        print("The number you guessed is greater.")
    else:
        print("The number you guessed is smaller.")
    guess_num = int(input("Input the number you guessed again:"))
    if guess_num == num:
        print("Great!")
    else:
        if guess_num > num:
            print("The number you guessed is greater.")
        else:
            print("The number you guessed is smaller.")
        guess_num = int(input("Input the number you guessed for the last time:"))
        if guess_num == num:
            print("Great!")
        else:
            print("Wow,you are an idiot.")
```

Run the codes:

```py
Input the number you guessed：6
The number you guessed is greater.
Input the number you guessed again:7
The number you guessed is greater.
Input the number you guessed for the last time:8
Wow,you are an idiot.
```
