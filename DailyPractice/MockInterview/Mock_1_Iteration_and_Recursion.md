# Iteration and Recursion

**Attentionï¼š**
1. When explaining recursion, don't say the result of each function as "result", call it "temporary variable" or "intermediate variable".
2. When exlaining the disadvantage of recursion, remember to mention "stack over flow".
3. Stack over flow has nothing to do with the computer for each programme in the computer is running separately.
