# Data Structure

**Attention:**

1. Data in python is stored in memory stack, it has its' own memory management, try to learn about reference counting and garbage collection.
2. When compare the memory heap and stack, best not mention about infinite loop as an example, this will cause both memory heap and stack go crash, we can say if there is a large code we need to run it, if it surpass the limit of memory stack, the stack overflow error will occur.
3. Signed integer is a data type that represents ingeters with both positive and negative values, the leftmost bit is often used to indicate the sign of the number. For example, in a 64-bit signed integer representation, the leftmost bit is reserved for the sign, and the remaining 63 bits are used to represent the number, and if the leftmost bit is 0, the number is positive, and if it's 1, the number is negative. On the opposite, unsigned integer is that all bits are used to represent number.
4. When asking about array and linked list, the array usually refers to the dynamic array, it's size can dynamically change at run time.
5. The main purpose of using a binary search tree is to search elements, best mention searching function before deletion and insertion.

**Still Need to Learn:**

1. Reference counting and garbage collection.
2. What is pass by value and pass by reference and what is the difference between them.
3. Learn about rebalance in binary search tree, and AVL, Red Black tree.
