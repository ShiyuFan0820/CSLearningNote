# Function

**Exercise: Number Guess Project**

1. Generate a random integer in range 1 to 100.
2. The guess game has two difficulty level -- easy and hard.
3. There are 5 guesses for hard level, 10 guesses for easy level.
4. Let user make a guess everytime and give feedback if the guessing number is too high or too low.
5. The game will not end until the user make a correct guess or run out of gusses.

**The code is:**
```py
from random import randint

def game(level):
    difficulty_level = {"easy": 10, "hard": 5}
    print(f"You have {difficulty_level[level]} attempts remaining to guess the number.")

    should_continue = True
    round = 0
    while should_continue:
        guess_num = int(input("Make a guess: "))
        round += 1
        remaining_attempt = difficulty_level[level] - round
        if guess_num > answer and remaining_attempt != 0:
            print(f"Too high.\nGuess again.\nYou have {remaining_attempt} attempts remaining to guess the number.")
        elif guess_num < answer and remaining_attempt != 0:
            print(f"Too low.\nGuess again.\nYou have {remaining_attempt} attempts remaining to guess the number.")
        elif guess_num == answer and remaining_attempt >= 0:
            should_continue = False
            print(f"You got it! The answer was {answer}.")
        elif guess_num > answer and remaining_attempt == 0:
            should_continue = False
            print("Too high.\nYou have run out of guesses, you lose.")
        else:
            should_continue = False
            print("Too low.\nYou have run out of guesses, you lose.")

answer = randint(1, 100)
print(f"Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!\nI'm thingking of a number between 1 and 100.\nPs: the correct answer is {answer}.")
level = input("Choose a difficulty. Type 'easy' or 'hard': ").lower()
game(level)
```

**Test the code:**
```py
#Test round 1:
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I'm thingking of a number between 1 and 100.
Ps: the correct answer is 54.
Choose a difficulty. Type 'easy' or 'hard': hard
You have 5 attempts remaining to guess the number.
Make a guess: 40
Too low.
Guess again.
You have 4 attempts remaining to guess the number.
Make a guess: 45
Too low.
Guess again.
You have 3 attempts remaining to guess the number.
Make a guess: 46
Too low.
Guess again.
You have 2 attempts remaining to guess the number.
Make a guess: 48
Too low.
Guess again.
You have 1 attempts remaining to guess the number.
Make a guess: 50
Too low.
You have run out of guesses, you lose.

#Test round 2:
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I'm thingking of a number between 1 and 100.
Ps: the correct answer is 65.
Choose a difficulty. Type 'easy' or 'hard': hard
You have 5 attempts remaining to guess the number.
Make a guess: 50
Too low.
Guess again.
You have 4 attempts remaining to guess the number.
Make a guess: 60
Too low.
Guess again.
You have 3 attempts remaining to guess the number.
Make a guess: 65
You got it! The answer was 65.
```

_**The better solution of the code:**_
```py
from random import randint

#Make function to set difficulty
def difficulty(level):
    difficulty_level = {"easy": 10, "hard": 5}
    print(f"You have {difficulty_level[level]} attempts to guess the number.")
    return difficulty_level[level]

#Make function to check user's guess against actual answer
def check_answer(guess, answer, turns):
    if guess > answer:
        print("Too high.")
        return turns - 1
    if guess < answer:
        print("Too low.")
        return turns - 1
    else:
        print(f"You got it! The answer was {answer}.")

#Generate a random integer in the range of 1-100
answer = randint(1, 100)
print(f"Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nPs, the correct answer is {answer}.")
level = input("Choose a difficulty. Type 'easy' or 'hard': ")
turns = difficulty(level)

#Let the user guess a number, repeat the guessing functionality if they get it wrong
guess = 0
while guess != answer:
    guess = int(input("Make a guess: "))
    turns = check_answer(guess, answer, turns)
    if turns == 0:
        print("You've run out if guesses, you lose!")
        break
    elif guess != answer:
        print(f"Guess again. You have {turns} attemps remaining to guess the number.")
```

_**Test the code:**_
```py
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Ps, the correct answer is 7.
Choose a difficulty. Type 'easy' or 'hard': hard
You have 5 attempts to guess the number.
Make a guess: 50
Too high.
Guess again. You have 4 attemps remaining to guess the number.
Make a guess: 25
Too high.
Guess again. You have 3 attemps remaining to guess the number.
Make a guess: 10
Too high.
Guess again. You have 2 attemps remaining to guess the number.
Make a guess: 5
Too low.
Guess again. You have 1 attemps remaining to guess the number.
Make a guess: 6
Too low.
You've run out if guesses, you lose!
