# Excercise 1 

**Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock**

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the i<sup>th</sup> day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

_Example 1:_
```py
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

_Example 2:_
```py
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

_Test case 1:_
```py
prices = [2, 4, 1]
```

_Test case 2:_
```py
prices = [2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2]
```

_First try: passed_
```py
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        profit = 0
        buy_day = 0
        for price in prices[1:]:
            if price > prices[buy_day]:
                profit = max(price - prices[buy_day], profit)
            else:
                buy_day = prices.index(price)
        return profit
```

# Exercise 2

**Contains Duplicate**

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

_Example 1:_
```py
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
```

_Example 2:_
```py
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
```

_First try:_
```py

```
