# Exercise 1

## Reverse String

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array **in-place** with `O(1)` extra memory.

_Example 1:_
```py
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

_Example 2:_
```py
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

**Solution: Passed**

Define two pointers, `front` and `rear` pointers, use `front` to move from beginning to the back, use `rear` pointer to move from back to beginning, if element of index `front` is not equal to the element of index `rear`, the two elements can exchange their position, once `front` is equal to `rear`, this means they are in the same position, the exchange end.
```py
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        front = 0
        rear = len(s) - 1
        while front < rear:
            if s[front] != s[rear]:
                s[front], s[rear] = s[rear], s[front]
            front += 1
            rear -= 1
```

**Solution: Passed**

Or just use `slice` method in Python to reverse the elements.
```py
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        s[:] = s[::-1]   
```

**Solution: Passed**

Or just use build-in `reverse` method in Python.
```py
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        s.reverse()
```


# Exercise 2

## Reverse Integer

Given a signed 32-bit integer `x`, return `x` with its digits reversed. If reversing `x` causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then return `0`.

**Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).**

_Example 1:_
```py
Input: x = 123
Output: 321
```

_Example 2:_
```py
Input: x = -123
Output: -321
```

_Example 3:_
```py
Input: x = 120
Output: 21
```
