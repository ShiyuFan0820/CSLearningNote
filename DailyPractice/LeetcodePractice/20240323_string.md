# Exercise 1

## First Unique Character in a String

Given a string `s`, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return `-1`.

_Example 1:_
```py
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 0
```

_Example 2:_
```py
Input: s = "loveleetcode"
Output: 2
```

_Example 3:_
```py
Input: s = "aabb"
Output: -1
```

**Solution: Passed**
```py
# Import Counter to count the number of every letter of s.
from collections import Counter
class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s: str) -> int:
        letter_counts = Counter(s)
        for letter in s:
            # If the count of number of letter is equal to 1, return the index of the letter.
            if letter_counts[letter] == 1
                return s.index(letter)
        # If no letter's count is equal to 1 means all letters are repeated, then return -1.
        return -1
```
