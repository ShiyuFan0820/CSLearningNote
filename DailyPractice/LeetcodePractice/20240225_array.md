# Exercise 1

**Intersection of Two Arrays II**

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in **any order**.

_Example 1:_
```py
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]
```

_Example 2:_
```py
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [4,9]
Explanation: [9,4] is also accepted.
```

_Test case 1:_
```py
nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1]
nums2 = [2]
```

_First try: Failed_
```py
class Solution:
    def intersect(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        intersection_nums = []
        for num in nums1:
            if num in nums2:
                intersection_nums.append(num)
        return intersection_nums
```

_**Fail Analysis: In the case like `Test case 1`, `2` appears twice in `nums1`, but it just appears once in `nums2`, so when the for loop reached the second `2` in `nums1`, and check if `2` is in `nums2`, the `intersection_num` would append the second `2`.**_
