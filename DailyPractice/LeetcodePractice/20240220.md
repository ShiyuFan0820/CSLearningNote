# Exercise 1

**Merge Sorted Array**

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

Merge `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

_Example 1:_
```py
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
```

_Example 2:_
```py
Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].
```

_Example 3:_
```py
Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.
```

_The test input:_

Case 1
```py
nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0]
m = 3
nums2 = [2, 5, 6]
n = 3
```

Case 2
```py
nums1 = [1]
m = 1
nums2 = [0]
n = 0
```

Case 3
```py
nums1 = [0]
m = 0
nums2 = [1]
n = 1
```

_The solution code 1: (passed)_
```py
class Solution(object):
    def merge(self, nums1, m, nums2, n):
        while m > 0 and n > 0:
            if nums1[m - 1] < nums2[n - 1]: # As nums1 and nums2 are both sorted in non-decrease order, we can compare the last element in both list to see which element is bigger, the biggest one will be placed in the last position in nums1, and continue compare the last element of the both lists.
                nums1[m + n - 1] = nums2[n - 1]
                n -= 1
            else:
                nums1[m + n -1] = nums1[m - 1]
                m -= 1
        if n > 0: # After comparison if there are still elements in nums2, means these elements are less than the same position's elements in nums1, replace the elements in nums1 at the same position to the elements in nums2
            nums1[:n] = nums2[:n] 

```

_The solution code 2: (passed)_
```py
class Solution(object):
    def merge(self, nums1, m, nums2, n):
        for ind in range(0, n):
            nums1[m] = nums2[ind]
            m += 1
        nums1.sort()
```

_A brief version:_
```py
class Solution():
    def merge(self, nums1, m, nums2, n):
    for i in range(n):
        nums1[m + i] = nums2[i] # i also adds 1 each loop, so we can use m adds i directly.
    nums1.sort()
```

# Exercise 2

**Remove Element**

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val`.

Consider the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val` be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

- Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the elements which are not equal to `val`. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
- Return `k`.

_Example 1:_
```py
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

_Example 2:_
```py
Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

_Test input:_

Case 1
```py
nums = [[0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0, 4, 2]
val = 2
```

Case 2
```py
nums = [[3, 2, 2, 3]
val = 3
```

_The solution code: (failed)_
```py
class Solution(object):
    def removeElement(self, nums, val):
        nums = [element for element in nums if element != val] 
```
_**Failed Analysisï¼š Python in leetcode may not support list comprehension, and the toptic said we need to return `k` and I didn't notice that.**_

_The second try: (failed)_
```py
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        k = 0 # Final return, the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val`.
        for ind in range(len(nums)):
            replace_ind = -1 
            if nums[ind] == val:
                while nums[replace_ind] == val: # Find an element which is nor equal to `val` from the last element in the list.
                    replace_ind -= 1
                if ind - replace_ind == len(nums) + 1: # This line is to see if the entire list is retrieved. The reason why add `1` is that when we finished moving all `val`s at the end of the list, the index difference bewteen the first element we find which is not equal to `val` and the index of the replaced value is 1.
                    k = ind
                    return k
                nums[ind] = nums[replace_ind] # If we find an element which is not equal to `val` we exchange the position of the two element.
                nums[replace_ind] = val

```
