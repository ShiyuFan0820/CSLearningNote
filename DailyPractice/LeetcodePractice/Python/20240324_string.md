# Exercise 1

## Valid Anagram

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

_Example 1:_
```py
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

_Example 2:_
```py
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

**Solution: Passed**
```py
from collections import Counter
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        # All original letters must be used exactly once so the length of this two words must be the same, if not, return False.
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False
        count_s = Counter(s)
        count_t = Counter(t)
        # All original letters must be used exactly once so the number of letters is also the same, if not, return False.
        for letter in s:
            if count_s[letter] != count_t[letter]:
                return False
        return True
```
