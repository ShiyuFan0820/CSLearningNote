# Exercise 1

**Valid Sudoku**

Determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated **according to the following rules:**
1. Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3. Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

**Note:**
 - A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
 - Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

_Example 1:_

</div>

```py
Input: board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true
```

_Example 2:_
```py
Input: board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
```

_First try: Failed_
```py
class Solution:
    def isValidSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        # Define a function to check the state of every row, column, and sub-boxes.
        def is_ok(check_item):
            check_set = {}
            for num in check_item:
                if num in check_set:
                    return False
                elif num in range(1, 10):
                    check_set.add(num)
            return True
        
        # Check digits in rows:
        for row in board:
            check_row = is_ok(row)
            if check_row is False:
                return False
        # Convert digits in columns into a list:
        column_list = list(zip(*board))
        for col in column_list:
            check_col = is_ok(col)
            if check_col is False:
                return False
            
        # Convert sub-boxes into a list:
        sub_boxes = [list(zip(*board[i: i+3])) for i in range(0, 9, 3)]
        sub_grids = [list(zip(*sub_box[i: i+3])) for sub_box in sub_boxes for i in range(0, 9, 3)]
        for sub_grid in sub_grids:
            for grid in sub_grid:
                check_grid = is_ok(grid)
                if check_grid is False:
                    return False
        return True
        
```

_**Fail Analysis: The issue lies in the condition `elif num in range(1, 10)`, all numbers in the list `board` are strings, so all elements in the `board` don't satisfy this condition, hence, no elements will be added to the `check_set`, causing the function to return `True`. And when creating an empty set we need to use `set()` instead of a `{}`, cause empty curly braces can refer to empty dictionary.**_

_**Failed Case**_
```py
Input: board=
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]


Output: True

Expected: False
```

_Second Try: Failed_
```py
class Solution:
    def isValidSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        def is_ok(check_item):
            check_set = set()
            for num in check_item:
                if num.isdigit() and int(num) in range(1, 10):
                    if int(num) in check_set:
                        return False
                    else:
                        check_set.add(int(num))
            return True
        
        # Check digits in rows:
        for row in board:
            check_row = is_ok(row)
            if check_row is False:
                return False
        # Convert digits in columns into a list:
        column_list = list(zip(*board))
        for col in column_list:
            check_col = is_ok(col)
            if check_col is False:
                return False
            
        # Convert sub-boxes into a list:
        sub_boxes = [list(zip(*board[i: i+3])) for i in range(0, 9, 3)]
        sub_grids = [list(zip(*sub_box[i: i+3])) for sub_box in sub_boxes for i in range(0, 9, 3)]
        for sub_grid in sub_grids:
            for grid in sub_grid:
                check_grid = is_ok(grid)
                if check_grid is False:
                    return False
        return True
```

_**Fail Analysis: When check the 3x3 sub-boxes, every 3 elements are in one tuple, and one tuple apply in the function a time, we can not check if there are duplicate elements in the 3x3 which is the 9 elements in the sub-boxes, we need to contain the 3x3 sub-boxes into one list.**_
