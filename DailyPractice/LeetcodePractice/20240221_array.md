# Exercise 1 

**Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in `nums`.

Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` to be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

- Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
- Return `k`.

_Example 1:_
```py
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

_Example 2:_
```py
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

_The solution code: (passed)_
```py
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        head_num = nums[0] # Store the head number to do comparison with the number next.
        k = 1 # Track the unique numbers starting from the second position.
        ind = 1 # The head number is already stored, retrieve from the second position.
        while ind < len(nums):
            if nums[ind] == head_num:
                ind += 1
            else:
                nums[k] = nums[ind]
                head_num = nums[ind]
                k += 1
                ind += 1
        return k
```
_The second try: (passed)_
```py
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0 # Return 0 is list `nums` is empty.
        k = 1
        ind = 1
        while ind < len(nums):
            if nums[ind] != nums[ind - 1]: # Instead of record the head number everytime just compare the number with the last number.
               nums[k] = nums[ind]
               k += 1
            ind += 1
        return k
        
```
