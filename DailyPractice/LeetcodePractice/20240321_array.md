# Exercise 1

You are given an `n x n` 2D `matrix` representing an image, rotate the image by **90** degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image **in-place**, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. **DO NOT** allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

_Example 1:_

<div align=center>
<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ShiyuFan0820/CSLearningNote/assets/149340606/b7089b8d-e12d-41d0-8ed6-a35783a45c37">
</div>

```py
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]
```

_Example 2:_

<div align=center>
<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ShiyuFan0820/CSLearningNote/assets/149340606/4b802651-d050-4e2f-a07f-4c694d0f0ee0">
</div>

```py
Input: matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]
Output: [[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]
```

**First Solution: Passed**

In the examples, it can be seen that elements in the same row became elements in the same column in the matrix, and the first row became the last column, the last row became the first column, and elements in the list with the larger index is in the more advanced position in every list inside the matrix, so the for loop can start from the last list or last row in the matrix, append the element in the list of matrix, and delete the first n elements then the result is the final matrix.
```py
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
        row = len(matrix) - 1
        while row >= 0:
            for col in range(len(matrix)):
                matrix[col].append(matrix[row][col])
            row -= 1
        for list in matrix:
            for i in range(len(matrix)):
                list.pop(0)
```
