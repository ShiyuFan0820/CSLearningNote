# List
**Exercise:**

Given a list with content [21, 25, 21, 23, 22, 20], using the list methods, perform the following operations:  
1. Define this list and assign it to a variable,  
2. Append the number `31` to the end of the list,  
3. Append a new list [29, 33, 30] to the end of the list,  
4. Delete the first element of the list(suppose to be `21`),  
5. Delete the last element of the list(suppose to be `30`),  
6. Find the index posotion of the element `31` in the list. 

The code is:
```py
mylist = [21, 25, 21, 23, 22, 20]
mylist.append(31)
print(mylist)

mylist2 = [29, 33, 30]
mylist.extend(mylist2)
print(mylist)

pop_num = mylist.pop(0)
print(pop_num)

pop_num = mylist.pop(-1)
print(pop_num)

index = mylist.index(31)
print(index)
```
Run the code:
```py
[21, 25, 21, 23, 22, 20, 31]
[21, 25, 21, 23, 22, 20, 31, 29, 33, 30]
21
