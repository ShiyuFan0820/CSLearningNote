# Print Command

**Exercise:**

Use print function in C to print your own name.

**The code is:**
```c
#include <stdio.h> // This directive is used to include the standard input and output library in C code, this library provides functions like "printf" and "scanf", which are essential for input and output operations. If this line of code is removed, the compiler may not recognize the "printf" function, and could encouter compilation errors.

int main() // This line declares the "main" function, which is the entry point of very C program. Execution of program starts from the "main" funciton.
{ // The opening curly brace "{" marks the beginning of the function body. All the statements and code within the curly braces belong to the main function.
    printf("First name: Shiyu\nLast nane: Fan");
    return 0; // A return value of 0 conventionally signifies that the program has executed without errors.
} // The closing curly brace "}" marks the end of the "main" function body. All the code related to the "main" function is contained between the opening and closing curly braces.
```

**The output is:**
```c
First name: Shiyu
Last nane: Fan
```
