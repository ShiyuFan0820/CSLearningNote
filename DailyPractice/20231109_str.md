# String Formatting

## Exercise：

**Define the following variables：**

- name:Quick Show
- stock_price:12.56
- stock_code:"003032"
- stock_price_daily_growth_factor:1.2
- growth_days:7

Calculate how much the stock price has reached after 7 days of growth？Use string formatting for output. If it is a floating point number, it requires 2 digits of decimal precision and requires output using f"{variables}" and % placeholders.

**The output should be like this:**

Company name:Quick Show,the stock code is:003032,the current stock price is:12.56.(This sentence requires the use of f"{variable}" to output)

The daily growth factor is:1.2,after seven days of growth, the stock price reached:(calculate with formula).(This sentence requires the use of % placeholders to output)

**The code is:**

```py
name = "Quick Show"
stock_price = 12.56
stock_code = "003032"
stock_price_daily_growth_factor = 1.2
growth_days = 7
print(f"Company name:{name},the stock code is:{stock_code},the current stock price is:{stock_price}.")
print("The daily growth factor is:%.2f,after %d days of growth,the stock price reached:%.2f." % (stock_price_daily_growth_factor,growth_days,12.56+1.2**7))
```

**The output is:**

```py
Company name:Quick Show,the stock code is:003032,the current stock price is:12.56.
The daily growth factor is:1.20,after 7 days of growth,the stock price reached:16.14.
```
