# CSV Data and Pandas Library (Updating)

**Exercise: Map Game**

1. Create a screen, set the background photo to the map of China.
2. Let users enter the name of the province.
3. Once the users enter the name and hit the "ok" button, if it's actually exists, add the name to the map.
4. Show the numbers of the correct names that the users entered.

**What will be made in the end:**



**Collapse the exercise into small blocks:**

1. Download an empty map from the internet.
2. Create a Turtle screen and set the map picture as the background.
3. Get the x and y cordinations of provinces on the screen.
4. Let users enter the name, one name at one time.
5. Check if the name in the name data file, if it is, show the corresponding position on the map and add one score to the total score.

**The code is:**
```py

```

_**Issues Recorded:**_

_1. The hardest part is how to get the coridnations of all provinces on the turtle screen._  

_Using the build-in function `onscreenclick` in turtle to print the cordinations and collect the data as a CSV file.
