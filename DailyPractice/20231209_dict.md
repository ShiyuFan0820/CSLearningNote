# Dictionary

**Exercise:**  
1. You have access to a database of `student_scores` in the format of a dictionary. The keys in `student_scores` are the names of the students and the values are their exam scores. The content of the dictionary is student_scores = {"Harry": 81, "Ron": 78, "Hermione": 99, "Draco": 74, "Neville": 62,}.
2. Write a program that converts their scores to grades. By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary called `student_grades` that should contain student names for keys and their grades for values.
3. This is the scoring criteria:
  - Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding"
  - Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"
  - Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable"
  - Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail"

**The code is:**
```py
student_scores = {
  "Harry": 81,
  "Ron": 78,
  "Hermione": 99, 
  "Draco": 74,
  "Neville": 62,
}

student_grades = {}
for key in student_scores:
  if 91 <= student_scores[key] <= 100:
    student_grades = {key: "Outstanding"}
  elif 81 <= student_scores[key] <= 90:
    student_grades = {key: "Exceeds Expectations"}
  elif 71 <= student_scores[key] <= 80:
    student_grades = {key: "Acceptable"}
  else:
    student_grades = {key: "Fail"}

print(student_grades)
```

**Run the code:**
```py
{'Neville': 'Fail'}
```

_**Error Analysis:**_  
_**The issue in this code is that the `student_grades` are overwrittend dictionary in each iteration of the loop, so end up with only the grade of the last student in the dictionary. To fix this, we should use the update method or directly assign the value to the specific key in the `student_grades` dictionary.**_

_**Corrected code:**_
```py
student_scores = {
  "Harry": 81,
  "Ron": 78,
  "Hermione": 99, 
  "Draco": 74,
  "Neville": 62,
}

student_grades = {}
for student in student_scores:
  score = student_scores[student]
  if score > 90:
    student_grades[student] = "Outstanding"
  elif score > 80:
    student_grades[student] = "Exceeds Expectations"
  elif score > 70:
    student_grades[student] = "Acceptable"
  else:
    student_grades[student] = "Fail"

print(student_grades)
```

_**Run the code:**_
```py
{'Harry': 'Exceeds Expectations', 'Ron': 'Acceptable', 'Hermione': 'Outstanding', 'Draco': 'Acceptable', 'Neville': 'Fail'}
```
