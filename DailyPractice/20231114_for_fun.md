# For Loop

**Excercise 1: Define the string variable "name", the content of "name" is "Everyday is a happy day", through the for loop, traverse this string, count how many letters "a" is the string, and print the number.**

The code is:

```py
name = "Everday is a happy day"
count = 0
for x in name:
    if x == "a":
        count += 1
print(f"There are {count} 'a's in the string being counted.")
```

Run the code:

```py
There are 4 'a's in the string being counted.
```

**Exercise 2: Through the for loop, output the contents of the multiplication table.**

The code is:

```py
for i in range(1, 10):
    for j in range(1, i + 1):
        print(f"{j} * {i} = {j * i}\t", end='')
    print()
```

Run the code:

```py
1 * 1 = 1	
1 * 2 = 2	2 * 2 = 4	
1 * 3 = 3	2 * 3 = 6	3 * 3 = 9	
1 * 4 = 4	2 * 4 = 8	3 * 4 = 12	4 * 4 = 16	
1 * 5 = 5	2 * 5 = 10	3 * 5 = 15	4 * 5 = 20	5 * 5 = 25	
1 * 6 = 6	2 * 6 = 12	3 * 6 = 18	4 * 6 = 24	5 * 6 = 30	6 * 6 = 36	
1 * 7 = 7	2 * 7 = 14	3 * 7 = 21	4 * 7 = 28	5 * 7 = 35	6 * 7 = 42	7 * 7 = 49	
1 * 8 = 8	2 * 8 = 16	3 * 8 = 24	4 * 8 = 32	5 * 8 = 40	6 * 8 = 48	7 * 8 = 56	8 * 8 = 64	
1 * 9 = 9	2 * 9 = 18	3 * 9 = 27	4 * 9 = 36	5 * 9 = 45	6 * 9 = 54	7 * 9 = 63	8 * 9 = 72	9 * 9 = 81
```

**Exercise 3:**

**A company has account balance of 10,000 RMB, the company needs to pay 20 employees:**  
- **Employees numbered from 1 to 20, starting with number 1, each person can receive 1,000 RMB,**
- **When receiving salary, the financial department judges the employee's performance score (1-10)(randomly generated). If it is lower than 5, no salary will be paid, and continue next one,**
- **If the account balance is over, the payment ends.**

The code is:

```py
staff = 1
money = 0
balance = 10000
for staff in range(1, 21):
   if money < 10000:
        import random
        score = random.randint(1, 10)
        if score >= 5:
            money += 1000
            print(f"Staff {staff} can get paid 1000 RMB, account balance is {balance - money} RMB.")
        else:
            print(f"The score of staff {staff} is {score}, no paid this month.")
print("Balance is empty, wait for the next month.")
```

Run the code:

```py
Staff 1 can get paid 1000 RMB, account balance is 9000 RMB.
Staff 2 can get paid 1000 RMB, account balance is 8000 RMB.
Staff 3 can get paid 1000 RMB, account balance is 7000 RMB.
Staff 4 can get paid 1000 RMB, account balance is 6000 RMB.
The score of staff 5 is 3, no paid this month.
Staff 6 can get paid 1000 RMB, account balance is 5000 RMB.
Staff 7 can get paid 1000 RMB, account balance is 4000 RMB.
The score of staff 8 is 4, no paid this month.
Staff 9 can get paid 1000 RMB, account balance is 3000 RMB.
Staff 10 can get paid 1000 RMB, account balance is 2000 RMB.
Staff 11 can get paid 1000 RMB, account balance is 1000 RMB.
Staff 12 can get paid 1000 RMB, account balance is 0 RMB.
Balance is empty, wait for the next month.
```

# Function

**Exercise 1: Not using built-in "len" function, statistics string length.**

The code is:

```py
str1 = "fanfan"
str2 = "xixi"
str3 = "happy"
def my_len(data):
    count = 0
    for i in data:
        count += 1
    print(f"The length of {data} is {count}")
my_len(str1)
my_len(str2)
my_len(str3)
```

Run the code:

```py
The length of fanfan is 6
The length of xixi is 4
The length of happy is 5
```

**Exercise 2: Define a function with an arbitrary name and accept an argument (numeric type, representing body temperature).
Body temperature is judged within the function (normal range: less than or equal to 37.5 degrees).**

The code is:

```py
def check(tem):
    if tem <= 37.5:
        print(f"Your temperature is {tem}, this temperature is of normal range.")
    else:
        print(f"Your temperature is {tem}, this temperature's out of range. You need to be quarantined.")

check(39)
check(36)
```

Run the code:

```py
Your temperature is 39, this temperature's out of range. You need to be quarantined.
Your temperature is 36, this temperature is of normal range.
```
