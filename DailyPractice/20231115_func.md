# Function

**Exercise: Happy Bank Program**
- Define a global variable named "money" to record the balance of the bank account(Default 50000),
- Define a globa variable named "name" to record the customer name (entered when starting the program),
- Define functions below:
  - Query balance function
  - Deposit function
  - Withdrawal function
  - Main menu function
- Requirement：
  - Request customer name after program startup,
  - After balance inquiry, deposit, withdrawal, the interface will return to the main menu,
  - After deposit and withdrawal, the current balance should be displayed,
  - If the customer opts out or enters an error, the program will exit, otherwise it will continue to run.

**The code is:**

```py
# Define the global variable:
money = 50000
# Ask customer for name：
name = input("Please enter your account name: ")
# Define query function：
def bal( ):
    print(f"{name}, your account balance is {money}.")
# Define top up function:
def dep(a):
    money += a
    print(f"{name}, your top-up operation is successful, your balance is {money}.")
# Define the withdraw function
def withdraw(b):
    money -= b
    print(f"{name}, your withdraw operation is successful, your balance is {money}.")
# Define the manu function:
def manu():
    print(f"Welcome to our Happy Bank, {name}!\nInsert '1' to check your balance.\nInsert '2' to top up your balance.\nInsert '3' to withdraw your balance.\nInsert '4' to log out")
    return input("Please enter your choice: ")
# Set infinite loop to ensure that the program does not exit：
while Ture:
    manu()
    cos_input = manu()
    if cos_input == 1:
        bal()
        continue # Continue to the next loop by "continue", returning to the main menu.
    elif cos_input == 2:
        num = int(input("How much you want to top up? "))
        dep(num)
        continue
    elif cos_input == 3:
        num = int(input("How much you want to withdraw? "))
        withdraw(num)
        continue
    elif cos_input == 4:
        print(f"{name}, thank you for your coming, see you next time!")
        break # Exit the loop by "break"
    else:
        print(f"Logged out.")
        break
```

**Run the code:**

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/fanfan/Downloads/200-Learning/250-Com/Pycharm/PythonLearning.py", line 21, in <module>
    while Ture:
          ^^^^
NameError: name 'Ture' is not defined
```

_**Error Analysis:**_

- _The spelling of `Ture` is wrong, it should be `True`._

- _In the `dep` and `withdraw` functions, a `global` should be added before `money` inside these functions._

- _In the `if` statements, the `cos_input` is a string, and it cannot be compared with an integer, so either converting the `cos_input` to an integer or converting the integer to a string._

- _There are twice `manu()` in the loop, the second one is not necessary._

_**Correction:**_

```py
# Define the global variable:
money = 50000
# Ask customer for name：
name = input("Please enter your account name: ")
print()
# Define query function：
def bal( ):
    print(f"{name}, your account balance is {money}.")
# Define top up function:
def dep(a):
    global money
    money += a
    print(f"{name}, your top-up operation is successful, your balance is {money}.")
# Define the withdraw function
def withdraw(b):
    global money
    money -= b
    print(f"{name}, your withdraw operation is successful, your balance is {money}.")
# Define the manu function:
def manu():
    print(f"Welcome to our Happy Bank, {name}!\nInsert '1' to check your balance.\nInsert '2' to top up your balance.\nInsert '3' to withdraw your balance.\nInsert '4' to log out")
    return input("Please enter your choice: ")
# Set infinite loop to ensure that the program does not exit：
while True:
    cos_input = manu()
    if cos_input == "1":
        bal()
        print()
        continue # Continue to the next loop by "continue", returning to the main menu.
    elif cos_input == "2":
        num = int(input("How much you want to top up? "))
        dep(num)
        print()
        continue
    elif cos_input == "3":
        num = int(input("How much you want to withdraw? "))
        withdraw(num)
        print()
        continue
    elif cos_input == "4":
        print(f"{name}, thank you for your coming, see you next time!")
        print()
        break # Exit the loop by "break"
    else:
        print(f"Logged out.")
        break
```
