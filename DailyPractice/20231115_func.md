# Function

**Exercise: Happy Bank Programme**
- Define a global variable named "money" to record the balance of the bank account(Default 50000),
- Define a globa variable named "name" to record the customer name (entered when starting the program),
- Define functions below:
  - Query balance function
  - Deposit function
  - Withdraw function
  - Main menu function
- Requirement：
  - Request customer name after program startup,
  - After balance inquiry, deposit, withdraw, the interface will return to the main menu,
  - After deposit and withdrawal, the current balance should be displayed,
  - If the customer opts out or enters an error, the program will exit, otherwise it will continue to run.

**The code is:**

```py
# Define the global variable:
money = 50000
# Ask customer for name：
name = input("Please enter your account name: ")
# Define query function：
def bal( ):
    print(f"{name}, your account balance is {money}.")
# Define top up function:
def dep(amout):
    money += amount
    print(f"{name}, your top-up operation is successful, your balance is {money}.")
# Define the withdraw function:
def withdraw(amount):
    money -= amount
    print(f"{name}, your withdraw operation is successful, your balance is {money}.")
# Define the manu function:
def menu():
    print(f"Welcome to our Happy Bank, {name}!\nInsert '1' to check your balance.\nInsert '2' to top up your balance.\nInsert '3' to withdraw your balance.\nInsert '4' to log out")
    return input("Please enter your choice: ")
# Set infinite loop to ensure that the program does not exit：
while Ture:
    menu()
    cus_input = menu()
    if cus_input == 1:
        bal()
        continue # Continue to the next loop by "continue", returning to the main menu.
    elif cus_input == 2:
        num = int(input("How much you want to top up? "))
        dep(num)
        continue
    elif cus_input == 3:
        num = int(input("How much you want to withdraw? "))
        withdraw(num)
        continue
    elif cus_input == 4:
        print(f"{name}, thank you for your coming, see you next time!")
        break # Exit the loop by "break"
    else:
        print(f"Logged out.")
        break
```

**Run the code:**

```py
Please enter your account name: Fanfan
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/fanfan/Downloads/200-Learning/250-Com/Pycharm/PythonLearning.py", line 21, in <module>
    while Ture:
          ^^^^
NameError: name 'Ture' is not defined
```

_**Error Analysis:**_

- _The spelling of `Ture` is wrong, it should be `True`._

- _In the `dep` and `withdraw` functions, a `global` should be added before `money` inside these functions._

- _In the `if` statements, the `cos_input` is a string, and it cannot be compared with an integer, so either converting the `cos_input` to an integer or converting the integer to a string._

- _There are twice `manu()` in the loop, the second one is not necessary._

_**Correction:**_

```py
# Define the global variable:
money = 50000
# Ask customer for name：
name = input("Please enter your account name: ")
print()
# Define query function：
def bal( ):
    print(f"{name}, your account balance is {money}.")
# Define top up function:
def dep(amount):
    global money
    money += amount
    print(f"{name}, your top-up operation is successful, your balance is {money}.")
# Define the withdraw function
def withdraw(amount):
    global money
    money -= amount
    print(f"{name}, your withdraw operation is successful, your balance is {money}.")
# Define the menu function:
def menu():
    print(f"Welcome to our Happy Bank, {name}!\nInsert '1' to check your balance.\nInsert '2' to top up your balance.\nInsert '3' to withdraw your balance.\nInsert '4' to log out")
    return input("Please enter your choice: ")
# Set infinite loop to ensure that the program does not exit：
while True:
    cus_input = menu()
    if cus_input == "1":
        bal()
        print()
        continue # Continue to the next loop by "continue", returning to the main menu.
    elif cus_input == "2":
        num = int(input("How much you want to top up? "))
        dep(num)
        print()
        continue
    elif cus_input == "3":
        num = int(input("How much you want to withdraw? "))
        withdraw(num)
        print()
        continue
    elif cus_input == "4":
        print(f"{name}, thank you for your coming, see you next time!")
        print()
        break # Exit the loop by "break"
    else:
        print(f"Logged out.")
        break
```

## Rewrite the code with the `class` (Updating)
**The code is:**
```py
class HappyBank:
    def __init__(self, name, init_balance):
        self.m_name = name
        self.m_balance = init_balance

    #Define the balance checking function:
    def balance(self):
        print(f"{self.m_name}, your balance is {self.m_balance}.")

    #Define the deposit funtion:
    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.m_balance += amount
        print(f"{self.m_name}, you add {amount} in your account, now your balance is {self.m_balance}.")

    #Define the withdraw function:
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        self.m_balance -= amount
        print(f"{self.m_name}, you withdraw {amount}, now your balance is {self.m_balance}.")

    #Define the menu function:
    def menu(self):
        print(f"Welcome to our Happy Bank, {self.m_name}!\nInsert '1' to check your balance.\nInsert '2' to top up your balance.\nInsert '3' to withdraw your balance.\nInsert '4' to exchange to another account.\nInsert '5' to log out.")

    #Define the exchange funtion:
    def exchange(self, new_name, new_balance):
        self.m_name = new_name
        self.m_balance = new_balance

name = input("If this is your first time to use our service, please enter your name: ")
init_balance = int(input("Please enter your initial balance: "))
user = HappyBank(name, init_balance)
should_continue = True

    if option == "1":
        user.balance()
    elif option == "2":
        amount = int(input("How much you want to top up: "))
        user.deposit(amount)
    elif option == "3":
        amount = int(input("How much you want to withdraw: "))
        user.withdraw(amount)
    elif option == "4":
        new_name = input("If this is your first time to use our service, please enter your name: ")
