# Class

**Exercise: Turtle Crossing Capstone (Updating)**  
1. A turtle can moves forwads, left and right when press the "Up", "Left" and "Right" key, no back.
2. Cars are randomly generated along the y-axis and will move from the right edge of the screen to the left edge.
3. When the turtle hits the top edge of the screen, it moves back to the original position and the player levels up. On the next level, the car speed increases.
4. When the turtle collides with a car, it's game over and everthing stops.

**What will be made in the end:**  
(I will update the video when I complete the code.)


**The code is:**
```py
from turtle import Turtle, Screen
from Car import Car
from User import User
import random
import time
# Create the car class
COLORS = ["black", "purple", "green", "yellow", "red", "blue",
          "orange", "pink"]
CAR_COLOR = random.choice(COLORS)
Y_AXIS = random.randint(-240, 250)


class Car(Turtle):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.shape("square")
        self.turtlesize(stretch_wid=1, stretch_len=2)
        self.color(CAR_COLOR)
        self.penup()
        self.goto(310, Y_AXIS)

    def move_car(self):
        self.backward(10)


# Create the user class
MOVE_STEP = 10


class User(Turtle):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.shape("turtle")
        self.color("green")
        self.penup()
        self.left(90)
        self.goto(0, -280)

    def move_up(self):
        if self.ycor() < 280:
            new_y = self.ycor() + MOVE_STEP
            self.goto(self.xcor(), new_y)

    def move_left(self):
        if self.xcor() > -290:
            new_x = self.xcor() - MOVE_STEP
            self.goto(new_x, self.ycor())

    def move_right(self):
        if self.xcor() < 280:
            new_x = self.xcor() + MOVE_STEP
            self.goto(new_x, self.ycor())


# Create the score class


# Create the game screen
screen = Screen()
screen.setup(600, 600)
screen.bgcolor("white")
screen.title("Turtle Crossing Capstone")
screen.tracer(0)

# Create objects
# Create cars randomly
all_cars = []
for car_num in range(100):
    new_car = Car()
    all_cars.append(new_car)
user = User()

# Control the user's movement by keys
screen.listen()
screen.onkey(user.move_up, "Up")
screen.onkey(user.move_left, "Left")
screen.onkey(user.move_right, "Right")

is_game_on = True
while is_game_on:
    time.sleep(0.1)
    screen.update()
    for car in all_cars:
        car.move_car()

screen.exitonclick()

```

_**Issues Recorded:**_  
_1. There was only one car even though I wrote the code to generate 100 cars._  

The code I wrote for the first time was (Just the relevant parts):
```py
# Create the car class
COLORS = ["black", "purple", "green", "yellow", "red", "blue",
          "orange", "pink"]
CAR_COLOR = random.choice(COLORS)
Y_AXIS = random.randint(-240, 250)


class Car(Turtle):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.shape("square")
        self.turtlesize(stretch_wid=1, stretch_len=2)
        self.color(CAR_COLOR)
        self.penup()
        self.goto(310, Y_AXIS)

    def move_car(self):
        self.backward(10)


# Create cars randomly
all_cars = []
for car_num in range(100):
    new_car = Car()
    all_cars.append(new_car)

is_game_on = True
while is_game_on:
    time.sleep(0.1)
    screen.update()
    for car in all_cars:
        car.move_car(random.randint(1, 10))

```
There was only one car:

</div>

_Issue Analysis:_  
The `CAR_COLOR` and `Y_AXIS` are outside the `Car` class, this means that all cars have the same color and same y cordination, resulting in all the cars overlap and look like there is only one car. To solve this problem the randomly choose shouldn't be put outside the class.

_2. There is no gap between the cars, the turtle can't cross through the cars._  

After moving the `CAR_COLOR` and `Y_AXIS` inside the class, there was another issue occured, all cars moved at the same time, and there was no gap for the turtle to cross through.

</div>

_Issue Analysis:_ 

According to the above code, all generated cars are outside the whiel loop, they will move out at the same time and will not be generated again, the cars are supposed to be generated as long as the while loop runs and generated only every few time. I define a `car_circle` variable that can add by 1 every time the game loop, check whether it is divisible by 3 as a condition to create a new car, in this way the car would continue to be generated.
