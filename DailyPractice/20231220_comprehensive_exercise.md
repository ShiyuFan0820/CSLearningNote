# Comprehensive Exercise

**Exercise: Coffee Machine**
1. Given the recipe of coffee and the stock material:
```py
coffe_menu = {
    "espresso": {"water": 50, "coffee": 18, "milk": 0, "cost": 1.5, "product": "‚òïÔ∏è"},
    "latte": {"water": 200, "coffee": 24, "milk": 150, "cost": 2.5, "product": "ü•§Ô∏è"},
    "cappuccino": {"water": 250, "coffee": 24, "milk": 100, "cost": 3, "product": "üçπÔ∏è"},
}

resources = {
    "water": 300,
    "milk": 200,
    "coffee": 100,
    "money": 0,
}
```
2. Let the user input what they want to buy.
3. When the user chooses a drink, the program should check if there are enough
resources to make that drink.
4. If there are sufficient resources to make the drink selected, then the program should
prompt the user to insert coins. Remember that quarters = $0.25, dimes = $0.10, nickles = $0.05, pennies = $0.01, calculate the menetary value of the coins inserted.
5. Check that the user has inserted enough money to purchase the drink they selected. E.g Latte cost $2.50, but they only inserted $0.52 then after counting the coins the
program should say `Sorry that's not enough money. Money refunded.` But if the user has inserted enough money, then the cost of the drink gets added to the
machine as the profit. If the user has inserted too much money, the machine should offer change.
6. If the transaction is successful and there are enough resources to make the drink the
user selected, then the ingredients to make the drink should be deducted from the
coffee machine resources, and ask the next user to insert their choices.
7. For maintainers of the coffee machine, they can use `off` or `report` as the secret word to turn off
the machine or to check the stock of resources. Your code should end execution when the maintainers use `off`.

**The code is:**
```py
# Define a coffee menu to store the recipe

        else:

**Test the code:**
```py
What would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino): latte
The cost of your latte is $2.5. Please insert coins.
How mant quarters?: 7
How mant dimes?: 7
How mant nickles?: 7
How mant pennies?: 7
The coins you inserted are $2.87 in total, here is $0.37 in change.
Here is your latte ü•§Ô∏è. Enjoy!
What would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino): report
Water: 100ml
Milk: 50ml
Coffee: 76g
Money: $2.5
What would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino): espresso
The cost of your espresso is $1.5. Please insert coins.
How mant quarters?: 9
How mant dimes?: 9
How mant nickles?: 9

The coins you inserted are $3.69 in total, here is $2.19 in change.
Here is your espresso ‚òïÔ∏è. Enjoy!
What would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino): cappuccino
Sorry there is not enough ['water', 'milk'].
What would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino): off
The machine has turned off.
