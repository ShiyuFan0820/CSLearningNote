# List
**Excercise: Password Generator Project**  
1. Define three lists, each of them consist of letters, symbols and numbers.
2. Ask for the users how many letters, numbers and symbols would they like in their passwords.
3. According to the input of the users, generate strong password for them, the order of the letters, symbols and numbers should be random.

**The code is:**

```py
import random
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z']
numbers = ['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9']
symbols = ['!', '#', '$', '%', '&', '(', ')', '*', '+']

num_letters = int(input("How many letters would you like in your password?\n"))
num_numbers = int(input("How many numbers would you like in your password?\n"))
num_symbols = int(input("How many symbols would you like in your password?\n")) #The type of the input is a string, so we need to convert it to an integer.

password_list = [] #Define a list to store the number of letters, symbols and numbers the users want.
for letter in range(num_letters):
    password_list.append(random.choice(letters))
for number in range(num_numbers):
    password_list.append(random.choice(numbers))
for symbol in range(num_symbols):
    password_list.append(random.choice(symbols)) #According to the input expected numbers of letters, numbers and symbols in password, using the "random.choice" function to select elements in the givin lists randomly, and using the "append" function to add them in the password list.

random.shuffle(password_list) #Reorder the password list randomly.
print(password_list) #But what we want to print is a password, we can't just print a list form, so we should define a new variable to store the actual password.
password = ""
for content in password_list:
    password += content
print(f"Your password is '{password}'.")
```
**Run the code:**

```py
How many letters would you like in your password?
4
How many numbers would you like in your password?
3
How many symbols would you like in your password?
2
['#', '%', '6', 'Q', '1', '9', 'R', 'o', 'g']
Your password is '#%6Q19Rog'.
```
