# Class

**Exercise: Pong Game (Updating)**
1. Pong Game is a game similar to Ping Pong.
2. Create a screen and draw a paddle at both left and right sides.
3. The ball bounces on the left and right sides of the screen.
4. Paddles on the left and right sides represent computer and user respectively, and the user can control the movement of the paddle by keys.
5. The paddle can only move up and down to catch the ball, if the user catch the ball, their score will add one point.
6. If the ball hits the paddles or walls, it will bounce in the opposite direction.

**Collipse the challenge into small blocks:**
1. Create a screen, set up the screen size and color.
2. Create a `Paddle` class to draw the two paddles, and define methods to make the paddles move.
3. Create a `Ball` class to draw a ball on the screen and make it bounce between the two paddles.
4. Detect the collision of the paddle and ball, create a score record class to show the score.

**The code is:**
```py
from turtle import Screen
from Paddle import Paddle
from Ball import Ball
import time


# Create the screen.
screen = Screen()
screen.setup(800, 600)
screen.bgcolor("black")
screen.title("Pong Game")
screen.tracer(0)


# Create the paddle class.
class Paddle(Turtle):
    def __init__(self, position):
        super().__init__()
        self.shape("square")
        self.penup()
        self.shapesize(stretch_wid=5, stretch_len=1)
        self.color("white")
        self.goto(position)

    def move_up(self):
        new_y = self.ycor() + 20
        self.goto(self.xcor(), new_y)

    def move_down(self):
        new_y = self.ycor() - 20
        self.goto(self.xcor(), new_y)


# Create the ball class.
class Ball(Turtle):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.shape("circle")
        self.color("white")
        self.penup()
        self.ball_move = 10

    def move(self):
        new_x = self.xcor() + 10
        new_y = self.ycor() + 10
        self.goto(new_x, new_y)

    def bounce(self):
        self.ball_move *= -1


# Create the paddle and ball objects.
r_paddle = Paddle((360, 0))
l_paddle = Paddle((-370, 0))
ball = Ball()
# Control the paddle with keys.
screen.listen()
screen.onkey(r_paddle.move_up, "Up")
screen.onkey(r_paddle.move_down, "Down")
screen.onkey(l_paddle.move_up, "w")
screen.onkey(l_paddle.move_down, "s")

is_game_on = True
while is_game_on:
    time.sleep(0.06)
    screen.update()
    ball.move()
    # Detect collision with walls.
    if ball.xcor() > 280 or ball.ycor() < -270:
        ball.bounce()


screen.exitonclick()

```

_**Issues Recorded:**_  
_1. The `bounce()` method in `Ball` class has no response._  
_My code was written as below at first:_
```py
is_game_on = True
while is_game_on:
    time.sleep(0.06)
    screen.update()
    if ball.xcor() < 380:
        ball.move()
    # Detect the collision with walls.
    else:
        ball.bounce()
```
_The reason the `bounce()` has no response is that in the while loop, `if ball.xcor() < 380` will first be detected, if the x cordination is greater than 380, the `ball.bounce()` will run once, and the while loop will start again, but in this round, after the first `ball.bounce()` has excuted, the x cordination is already less than 380, it will run `ball.move()`, and this causes these two functions to alternate all the time, the ball will not bounce constantly in the opposite direction._
