# Class

**Exercise: Snake Game (Updating)**
1. Using the build-in function `turtle` to define a short "snake".
2. Use four keys to control the snake's movement, "w" represents moving forward, "s" represents moving downward, "d" represents turning right, "a" represents turning left.
3. A bean will appear randomly on the screen, and when the bean are eaten by snake, the bean will randomly change positions again.
4. Everytime After the snake eating the bean, it will grow longer.
5. If the snake hits the wall or itself, the game ends.

**Collapse the exercise into small blocks and then try to complete the code:**

1. Import the `Turtle` and `Screen` class from `turtle`.
2. Define 3 turtles and change the shape into square, change the x cordination to make the square in a line, in this way the three square will look like a simple snake.


**The code is:**
```py
from turtle import Turtle, Screen

# Define the game screen.
screen = Screen()
screen.setup(width=600, height=600)
screen.bgcolor("black")

# To create the snake we can create 3 turtles and position them in a line.
turtle_1 = Turtle("square")
turtle_1.color("white")

turtle_2 = Turtle("square")
turtle_2.color("white")
turtle_2.goto(x=-20, y=0)

turtle_3 = Turtle("square")
turtle_3.color("white")
turtle_3.goto(x=-40, y=0)

screen.exitonclick()

```
