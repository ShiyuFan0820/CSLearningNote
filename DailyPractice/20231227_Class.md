# Class

**Exercise: Snake Game (Updating)**
1. Using the build-in function `turtle` to define a short "snake".
2. Use four keys to control the snake's movement, up, down, right, left arrow keys.
3. A bean will appear randomly on the screen, and when the bean are eaten by snake, the bean will randomly change positions again.
4. Everytime After the snake eating the bean, it will grow longer.
5. If the snake hits the wall or itself, the game ends.

**Collapse the exercise into small blocks and then try to complete the code:**

1. Import the `Turtle` and `Screen` class from `turtle`.
2. Create a `Snake` class to generate a snake
    - Define 3 turtles and change the shape into square, change the x cordination to make the square in a line, in this way the three square will look like a simple snake.
    - Use methods built in the `Turtle` to make the snake move forward, downward, left and right.
    - Use the keys to control the movement when press the certain arrow.
    - Notice that the snake can't turn around, meaning it can't suddenly turn down when it is facing up, or to the left when it is facing right, and vice versa.
3. Create a `Bean` class to generate the bean randomly.
    - Inherite the `Tuetle` class, to generate a turtle in circle shape.
    - Set the boundaries within which beans can appear.
    - Define a method to refresh the bean's location everytime the snake get the bean.
4. Create a `Score` class to calculate the score.
    - Inherite the `Tuetle` class, to generate a scoreboard to show the score.
    - Define a method to add score if the snake get the bean.
5. Detect the collision with the walls and snake tail.

**The code is:**
