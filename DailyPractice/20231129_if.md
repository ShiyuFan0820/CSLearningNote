# If statement

**Exercise:**

You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people. To work out the love score between two people:

1. Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.

2. Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.

3. Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be: "Your score is *x*, you go together like coke and mentos."

For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be: "Your score is *y*, you are alright together."

Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.: "Your score is *z*."

**The code is:**
```py
print("The Love Calculator is calculating your score...")
name1 = input() 
name2 = input() 
add_name = name1 + name2 #Combine the two names together.
lower_name = add_name.lower() #To prevent ambiguity, convert all letters to lowercase（capitalization is also ok.）
t = lower_name.count("t")
r = lower_name.count("r")
u = lower_name.count("u")
e = lower_name.count("e")
first_digit = t + r + u + e
l = lower_name.count("l")
o = lower_name.count("o")
v = lower_name.count("v")
e = lower_name.count("e")
second_digit = l + o + v + e
final_score = str(first_digit) + str(second_digit)
score = int(final_score)
if score < 10 or score > 90:
  print(f"Your score is {score}, you go together like coke and mentos.")
elif 40 < score < 50:
  print(f"Your score is {score}, you are alright together.")
else:
  print(f"Your score is {score}.")
```

**Test the code:**
```py
The Love Calculator is calculating your score...
David Beckham
Victoria Beckham
Your score is 45, you are alright together.
```
