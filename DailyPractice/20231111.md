# If Statement

Exercise:Define a variable of the type of number, the number can be arbitrary, based on the input statement to enter the guessed number, through the combination of if and multiple elif, to determine whether the guessed number is the given number.

The codes are:

```py
num = 7
guess_num = int(input("Please inster a number:"))
if guess_num == num:
    print("You are right!")
elif guess_num = int(input("You are wrong,guess again:")) == num:
    print("You are right!")
elif guess_num = int(input("You are wrong,you can guess one last time:")) == num:
    print("You are right!")
else:
    print(f"Sorry,none of you answers are right,the right number is:{num}")
```

Run the codes:

```py
    elif guess_num = int(input("You are wrong,guess again:")) == num:
         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Maybe you meant '==' or ':=' instead of '='?
```

_**Error Analysis:**_

 _In the elif statement, there are some things mixed up in the conditional judgment and input statement. You should receive the user's input first, and then use that input in a conditional judgment_
 
_**Correction:**_

_The codes are:_

```py
num = 7
if int(input("Guess a number:")) == num:
    print("You are right!")
elif int(input("You are wrong,guess again:")) == num:
    print("You are right!")
elif int(input("You are wrong,guess one last time:")) == num:
    print("You are right!")
else:
    print(f"You are wrong!The correct number is {num}!")
```

_Run the codes:_

```py
Guess a number:1
You are wrong,guess again:2
You are wrong,guess one last time:3
You are wrong!The correct number is 7!
```
