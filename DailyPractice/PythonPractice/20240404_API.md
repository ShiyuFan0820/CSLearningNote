# API

## My Workout Tracker

1. This practice is to build an exercise tracking application using Python.
2. Users can insert what exercise they did and their exercise can be recorded automatically to Google Sheets.
3. The application should track the date, how long the exercise is, and what is the amount of calories.
4. The API used in this project is [Nutritionix API website](https://www.nutritionix.com/business/api), and [Sheety website](https://sheety.co/).

## What Will Be Made in The End

## Steps

1. Go to Google Spreadsheet to create a [My_Workout Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Ov7eWig5ZOEH1P89ALjBA7K5Z95qLASuILEwQU6u1o/edit#gid=0).
2. Go to [Nutritionix API website](https://www.nutritionix.com/business/api) and select `Get Your API Key` to sign up for a free account.
3. Go to [Sheety website](https://sheety.co/) to connect the Google sheet.
4. After finishing writing the code, and test successfully, inorder to secure the API key and ID, set the key and ID as environment variables, so other uses can't access API unless they have the key and ID, to set environment variables in Pycharm, open `Run configuration`, and click `Edit Configurations`, when open the edit window, click `+` button on the upper left corner to `Add New Configuration`, choose a `Python` configuration, remember to add the path of the `main.py` file to the script, otherwise the `main.py` can't run successfully, next add environment variables in `Environment variables`, the contents don't neet to add `""` symbol.
5. Import `os` module to access the environment variables in the code.
```py
import requests
from datetime import datetime
import os

# Define variables to store endpoint information.
exercise_endpoint = "https://trackapi.nutritionix.com/v2/natural/exercise"
sheety_endpoint = "https://api.sheety.co/596407487435113fa1b524e86a87b95d/workoutTracker/workouts"

# Define variables to store API information.
APIID = os.environ["API_ID"]
APIKey = os.environ["API_KEY"]

# Prepare relevant parameters according to the parameter requirements on the website.
headers = {
    "x-app-id": APIID,
    "x-app-key": APIKey
}

exercise_text = input("What exercise you did today? ")
params = {
    "query": exercise_text
}
# Get exercises information.
exercise_response = requests.post(url=exercise_endpoint, headers=headers, json=params)
exercise_result = exercise_response.json()
print(exercise_result)

today_date = datetime.now().strftime("%d/%m/%Y")
now_time = datetime.now().strftime("%X")
basic_auth = (os.environ["user_name"], os.environ["password"])
for exercise in exercise_result["exercises"]:
    sheet_inputs = {
        "workout": {
            "date": today_date,
            "time": now_time,
            "exercise": exercise["name"].title(),
            "duration (min)": exercise["duration_min"],
            "calories": exercise["nf_calories"]
        }
    }
    sheety_response = requests.post(url=sheety_endpoint, json=sheet_inputs, auth=basic_auth)

```
