# For Loop

Exercise:Sum 0 to 100.

```py
for i in range(0,100):
    print(sum(i+i+1))
```

The outcome is:

```py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/fanfan/Downloads/200-Learning/250-Com/Pycharm/PythonLearning.py", line 2, in <module>
    print(sum(i+i+1))
          ^^^^^^^^^^
TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
```

_**Error Analysis:**_

_The `sum()` function is used to calculate the sum of a given iterable, but the codes above were trying to pass an integer to the `sum()` function, which is incorrect. Second, the loop also had issues because it prints a value in each iteration, while the goal is to calculate the sum._

_**Correction:**_

```py
j = 0
for i in range(0,101):
    j = j + i
print(j)
```

_**The outcome is:**_

```py
5050
```
