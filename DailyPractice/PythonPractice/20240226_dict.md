# Dictionary

**Exercise 1:**

Write a function `dict_merge_sum` that takes two dictionaries `d1` and `d2` as parameters. The values of both dictionaries are numerical. The function should return the merged sum dictionary `m` of those dictionaries. If a key k is both in `d1` and `d2`, the corresponding values will be added and included in the dictionary `m` If `k` is only contained in one of the dictionaries, the `k` and the corresponding value will be included in `m`.


**Exercise 2:**

Given is the following simplified data of a supermarket:
```py
supermarket = { "milk": {"quantity": 20, "price": 1.19},
               "biscuits":  {"quantity": 32, "price": 1.45},
               "butter":  {"quantity": 20, "price": 2.29},
               "cheese":  {"quantity": 15, "price": 1.90},
               "bread":  {"quantity": 15, "price": 2.59},
               "cookies":  {"quantity": 20, "price": 4.99},
               "yogurt": {"quantity": 18, "price": 3.65},
               "apples":  {"quantity": 35, "price": 3.15},
               "oranges":  {"quantity": 40, "price": 0.99},
               "bananas": {"quantity": 23, "price": 1.29}}
```
To be ready for an imminent crisis you decide to buy everything. This isn't particularly social behavior, but for the sake of the task, let's imagine it. The question is how much will you have to pay?

**Exercise 3:**

1. Create a virtual supermarket. For every article there is a price per article and a quantity, i.e. the stock. (Hint: you can use the one from the previous exercise!)
2. Create shopping lists for customers. The shopping lists contain articles plus the quantity.
3. The customers fill their carts, one after the other. Check if enough goods are available! Create a receipt for each customer.

**Exercise 4:**

Write Pyhton code to create a dictionary with the city names as keys and the corresponding areas and population numbers as values. The data is as follows:
```py
cities = ['Stuttgart', 'Karlsruhe', 'Mannheim', 'Freiburg', 'Heidelberg', 'Heilbronn']
areas = [207.35, 173.46, 144.96, 153.07, 108.83, 99.88]  # Areas are in square kilometers
populations = [634830, 313092, 309370, 230241, 160355, 125960]
```


**Exercise 5: Student Gradebook using Nested Dictionaries**

Create a Python program to manage a student gradebook using nested dictionaries. Follow these steps to implement the functionality:

1. Initialize an empty dictionary to serve as the gradebook.
2. Implement a function `add_student(gradebook, student_name)` that takes the gradebook dictionary and a student name as input and adds an empty dictionary for the student's grades to the gradebook.
3. Implement a function `add_grade(gradebook, student_name, subject, grade)` that takes the gradebook dictionary, a student name, a subject name, and a grade as input. This function should add the grade for the specified subject to the grades dictionary of the specified student in the gradebook.
4. Implement a function `calculate_average_grade(gradebook, student_name)` that takes the gradebook dictionary and a student name as input and calculates the average grade for the specified student.
5. Implement a function `display_gradebook(gradebook)` that takes the gradebook dictionary as input and displays the contents of the gradebook, including student names, subjects, and grades, as well as the average grade for each student.

Use the provided sample usage to demonstrate the functionality of your program.

An example dictionary may look like this:
```py
{'Alice': {'Math': 85, 'Science': 90, 'History': 88},
 'Bob': {'Math': 78, 'Science': 92, 'History': 85}}
```
