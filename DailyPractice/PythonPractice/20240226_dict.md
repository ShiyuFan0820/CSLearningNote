# Dictionary

**Exercise 1:**

1. Write a function `dict_merge_sum` that takes two dictionaries `d1` and `d2` as parameters.
2. The values of both dictionaries are numerical. The function should return the merged sum dictionary `m` of those dictionaries.
3. If a key `k` is both in `d1` and `d2`, the corresponding values will be added and included in the dictionary `m`.
4. If `k` is only contained in one of the dictionaries, the `k` and the corresponding value will be included in `m`.

_The code is_
```py
def dict_merge_sum(d1, d2):
    for key, value in d1.item():
        if key in d2:
            d2[key] += value
        else:
            d2[key] = value
    m = d2.copy()
    return m

# Test code:
d1 = dict(a=4, b=5, d=8)
d2 = dict(a=1, d=10, e=9)
merged_sum = dict_merge_sum(d1, d2)
print(merged_sum)
```

_The output is_
```py
{'a': 5, 'd': 18, 'e': 9, 'b': 5}
```

**Exercise 2:**

Given is the following simplified data of a supermarket:
```py
supermarket = { "milk": {"quantity": 20, "price": 1.19},
               "biscuits":  {"quantity": 32, "price": 1.45},
               "butter":  {"quantity": 20, "price": 2.29},
               "cheese":  {"quantity": 15, "price": 1.90},
               "bread":  {"quantity": 15, "price": 2.59},
               "cookies":  {"quantity": 20, "price": 4.99},
               "yogurt": {"quantity": 18, "price": 3.65},
               "apples":  {"quantity": 35, "price": 3.15},
               "oranges":  {"quantity": 40, "price": 0.99},
               "bananas": {"quantity": 23, "price": 1.29}}
```
To be ready for an imminent crisis you decide to buy everything. This isn't particularly social behavior, but for the sake of the task, let's imagine it. The question is how much will you have to pay?

_The code is:_
```py
supermarket = { "milk": {"quantity": 20, "price": 1.19},
               "biscuits":  {"quantity": 32, "price": 1.45},
               "butter":  {"quantity": 20, "price": 2.29},
               "cheese":  {"quantity": 15, "price": 1.90},
               "bread":  {"quantity": 15, "price": 2.59},
               "cookies":  {"quantity": 20, "price": 4.99},
               "yogurt": {"quantity": 18, "price": 3.65},
               "apples":  {"quantity": 35, "price": 3.15},
               "oranges":  {"quantity": 40, "price": 0.99},
               "bananas": {"quantity": 23, "price": 1.29}}
bill = 0
for item in supermarket.values():
    bill += (item["quantity"] * item["price"])
print(f"The totol price for buying everything in the supermarket is {bill}.")
```

_The output is:_
```py
The totol price for buying everything in the supermarket is 528.37.
```

**Exercise 3:**

1. Create a virtual supermarket. For every article there is a price per article and a quantity, i.e. the stock. (Hint: you can use the one from the previous exercise!)
2. Given a created shopping lists for customers. The shopping lists contain articles plus the quantity.
3. The customers fill their carts, one after the other. Check if enough goods are available! Create a receipt for each customer.

```py
# Given information
supermarket = { "milk": {"quantity": 20, "price": 1.19},
               "biscuits":  {"quantity": 32, "price": 1.45},
               "butter":  {"quantity": 20, "price": 2.29},
               "cheese":  {"quantity": 15, "price": 1.90},
               "bread":  {"quantity": 15, "price": 2.59},
               "cookies":  {"quantity": 20, "price": 4.99},
               "yogurt": {"quantity": 18, "price": 3.65},
               "apples":  {"quantity": 35, "price": 3.15},
               "oranges":  {"quantity": 40, "price": 0.99},
               "bananas": {"quantity": 23, "price": 1.29}}
customers = ["Frank", "Mary", "Paul"]
shopping_lists = {
   "Frank" : [('milk', 5), ('apples', 5), ('butter', 1), ('cookies', 1)],
   "Mary":  [('apples', 2), ('cheese', 4), ('bread', 2), ('pears', 3),
             ('bananas', 4), ('oranges', 1), ('cherries', 4)],
   "Paul":  [('biscuits', 2), ('apples', 3), ('yogurt', 2), ('pears', 1),
             ('butter', 3), ('cheese', 1), ('milk', 1), ('cookies', 4)]}

# Write code below
receipt = {}
for customer in customers:
    receipt[customer] = []
    for article, quantity in shopping_lists[customer]:
        if article in supermarket and supermarket[article]["quantity"] != 0:
            if quantity > supermarket[article]["quantity"]:
                quantity = supermarket[article]["quantity"]
            receipt[customer].append((article, quantity, round(quantity * supermarket[article]["price"], 2)))
            supermarket[article]["quantity"] -= quantity

print("------Check Out------")
for customer in customers:
    print(f"\nReceipt for {customer}: ")
    total_bill = 0
    for article, quantity, bill in receipt[customer]:
        print(f"{article}, quantity: {quantity}, bill: {bill}.")
        total_bill += bill
    print(f"Total bill is {round(total_bill, 2)}.")
```

_The output is:_
```py
------Check Out------

Receipt for Frank: 
milk, quantity: 5, bill: 5.95.
apples, quantity: 5, bill: 15.75.
butter, quantity: 1, bill: 2.29.
cookies, quantity: 1, bill: 4.99.
Total bill is 28.98.

Receipt for Mary: 
apples, quantity: 2, bill: 6.3.
cheese, quantity: 4, bill: 7.6.
bread, quantity: 2, bill: 5.18.
bananas, quantity: 4, bill: 5.16.
oranges, quantity: 1, bill: 0.99.
Total bill is 25.23.

Receipt for Paul: 
biscuits, quantity: 2, bill: 2.9.
apples, quantity: 3, bill: 9.45.
yogurt, quantity: 2, bill: 7.3.
butter, quantity: 3, bill: 6.87.
cheese, quantity: 1, bill: 1.9.
milk, quantity: 1, bill: 1.19.
cookies, quantity: 4, bill: 19.96.
Total bill is 49.57.
```

**Exercise 4:**

Write Pyhton code to create a dictionary with the city names as keys and the corresponding areas and population numbers as values. The data is as follows:
```py
cities = ['Stuttgart', 'Karlsruhe', 'Mannheim', 'Freiburg', 'Heidelberg', 'Heilbronn']
areas = [207.35, 173.46, 144.96, 153.07, 108.83, 99.88]  # Areas are in square kilometers
populations = [634830, 313092, 309370, 230241, 160355, 125960]
```

_The code is_
```py
cities = ['Stuttgart', 'Karlsruhe', 'Mannheim', 'Freiburg', 'Heidelberg', 'Heilbronn']
areas = [207.35, 173.46, 144.96, 153.07, 108.83, 99.88]  # Areas are in square kilometers
populations = [634830, 313092, 309370, 230241, 160355, 125960]

cities_info = {city: {"areas": area, "population": population} for city, area, population in zip(cities, areas, populations)}
print(cities_info)
```

_The output is:_
```py
': {'areas': 99.88, 'population': 125960}}
{'Alice': {'Math': 85, 'Science': 90, 'History': 88}, 'Bob': {'Math': 78, 'Science': 92, 'History': 85}}
```

**Exercise 5: Student Gradebook using Nested Dictionaries**

Create a Python program to manage a student gradebook using nested dictionaries. Follow these steps to implement the functionality:

1. Initialize an empty dictionary to serve as the gradebook.
2. Implement a function `add_student(gradebook, student_name)` that takes the gradebook dictionary and a student name as input and adds an empty dictionary for the student's grades to the gradebook.
3. Implement a function `add_grade(gradebook, student_name, subject, grade)` that takes the gradebook dictionary, a student name, a subject name, and a grade as input. This function should add the grade for the specified subject to the grades dictionary of the specified student in the gradebook.
4. Implement a function `calculate_average_grade(gradebook, student_name)` that takes the gradebook dictionary and a student name as input and calculates the average grade for the specified student.
5. Implement a function `display_gradebook(gradebook)` that takes the gradebook dictionary as input and displays the contents of the gradebook, including student names, subjects, and grades, as well as the average grade for each student.

Use the provided sample usage to demonstrate the functionality of your program.

An example dictionary may look like this:
```py
{'Alice': {'Math': 85, 'Science': 90, 'History': 88},
 'Bob': {'Math': 78, 'Science': 92, 'History': 85}}
```

_The code is:_
```py
def add_student(gradebook, student_name):
    gradebook[student_name] = {}

def add_grade(gradebook, student_name, subject, grade):
    gradebook[student_name][subject] = grade

def calculate_average_grade(gradebook, student_name):
    average_grade = sum(gradebook[student_name].values()) / len(gradebook[student_name].keys())
    gradebook[student_name]["average"] = round(average_grade, 2)


def display_gradebook(gradebook):
    for student in gradebook:
        print(f"\n{student}: ")
        for subject, grade in gradebook[student].items():
            print(f"- {subject}: {grade}")

gradebook = {}
add_student(gradebook, "Alice")
add_student(gradebook, "Bob")
add_grade(gradebook, "Alice", "Math", 85)
add_grade(gradebook, "Alice", "Science", 90)
add_grade(gradebook, "Alice", "History", 88)
add_grade(gradebook, "Bob", "Math", 78)
add_grade(gradebook, "Bob", "Science", 92)
add_grade(gradebook, "Bob", "History", 85)
calculate_average_grade(gradebook, "Alice")
calculate_average_grade(gradebook, "Bob")
display_gradebook(gradebook)
```

_The output is:_
```py
Alice: 
- Math: 85
- Science: 90
- History: 88
- average: 87.67

Bob: 
- Math: 78
- Science: 92
- History: 85
- average: 85.0
```
