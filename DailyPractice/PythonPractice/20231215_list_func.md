# List and Function

**Exercise: Blackjack Project**

Write a code to run the Blackjack Project, the rules of the game are as follows:
1. Create a deck to deal the card, the deck is unlimited in size.
2. There are no jokers, the Jack, Queen and King all count as 10, the Ace can count as 11 or 1, depending on the score of the sum of the cards.
3. In the first round, both user and dealer (the computer) will be given two cards, if either side has a blackjack (Ace and 10 appear at the same time), they win.
4. If either side'score over 21, and there is no Ace in their cards, the side lose. If there is an Ace in their cards, replace the 11 with 1 to see if the score still over 21.
5. In the next round, ask the user if they want to get another card, draw them another card if they want to, draw dealer another card if the user don't want to, but make sure the dealer only get a card then their score is less than 17.
6. Check if either side's score is over 21, if not, compare the user's score with the dealer's score to see which one is higher.

**The code is:**
```py
import random
#Define a function to deal cards to the user and dealer.
def deal_card(): 
    cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
    card = random.choice(cards)
    return card

#Define a function to calculate their score.
def calculate_score(cards): 
    if sum(cards) == 21 and len(cards) == 2:
        return 0
    if 11 in cards and sum(cards) > 21:
        cards.remove(11)
        cards.append(1)
    return sum(cards)

user_card = []
dealer_card = []
for _ in range(2):
    user_card.append(deal_card())
    dealer_card.append(deal_card())

should_continue = True
while should_continue:
    user_score = calculate_score(user_card)
    dealer_score = calculate_score(dealer_card)
    print(f"Your card is {user_card}, your score is {user_score}.")
    print(f"Dealer's first card is {dealer_card[0]}.")

    if user_score == 0 or dealer_score == 0 or user_score > 21:
        should_continue = False
        if user_score == 0 or user_score > 21:
            print("You lose!")
        else:
            print("You win!")
    else:
        user_choice = input("Do you want another card? Type 'yes' or 'no': ").lower()
        if user_choice == "yse":
            user_card.append(deal_card())
        else:
            should_continue = False
            if dealer_score < 17:
                dealer_card.append(deal_card())
            if dealer_score > 21 or user_score > dealer_score:
                print("You win!")
            elif dealer_score == user_score:
                print("It's a draw.")
            else:
                print("You lose!")
```

**Issue:**

When I test the code, it doesn't run as expected, it's supposed to run the second round when I type `yes` and print the new score and make comparison, or run the next step if I type `no`, however, everytime after I inserting my choice, it just shows one line like this:
```py
#The first time I ran the code:
Your card is [10, 10], your score is 20.
Dealer's first card is 10.
Do you want another card? Type 'yes' or 'no': yes
You win!

#The secomd time I ran the code:
Your card is [5, 3], your score is 8.
Dealer's first card is 7.
Do you want another card? Type 'yes' or 'no': no
You lose!

#The third time I ran the code:
Your card is [4, 11], your score is 15.
Dealer's first card is 11.
Do you want another card? Type 'yes' or 'no': yes
You lose!
```

_**Error Analysis:**_

_**In the `user_choice`, the contion of the if statement is `if user_choice == "yse"`, but we actually expect the users type `yes`, leading to run the `else` branch, and eventually get the output of `You win!` or `You lose!`**_

_**Correction:**_
```py
import random
def deal_card():
    cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
    card = random.choice(cards)
    return card

def calculate_score(cards):
    if sum(cards) == 21 and len(cards) == 2:
        return 0
    if 11 in cards and sum(cards) > 21:
        cards.remove(11)
        cards.append(1)
    return sum(cards)

#Define a comparing function:
def compare(user_score, dealer_score):
    if user_score == dealer_score:
        return "It's a draw."
    elif user_score > 21:
        return "Your score is over 21, you lose!"
    elif dealer_score > 21:
        return "The dealer'score is over 21, you win!"
    elif user_score == 0:
        return "You have a Blackjack, you win!"
    elif dealer_score == 0:
        return "The dealer has a Blackjack, you lose!"
    elif user_score > dealer_score:
        return "You win!"
    else:
        return "You lose!"

user_card = []
dealer_card = []
for _ in range(2):
    user_card.append(deal_card())
    dealer_card.append(deal_card())

should_continue = True
while should_continue:
    user_score = calculate_score(user_card)
    dealer_score = calculate_score(dealer_card)
    print(f"Your card is {user_card}, your score is {user_score}.")
    print(f"Dealer's first card is {dealer_card[0]}.")

    if user_score == 0 or dealer_score == 0 or user_score > 21:
        should_continue = False
    else:
        user_choice = input("Do you want another card? Type 'yes' or 'no': ").lower()
        if user_choice == "yes":
            user_card.append(deal_card())
        else:
            should_continue = False
if dealer_score != 0 and dealer_score < 17:
    dealer_card.append(deal_card())
    calculate_score(dealer_card)
print(f"Your final hand: {user_card}, final score: {user_score}.")
print(f"Dealer's final hand: {dealer_card}, final score: {dealer_score}.")
print(compare(user_score, dealer_score))
```
_**Test the code:**_
```py
#Test the first time:
Your card is [11, 7], your score is 18.
Dealer's first card is 10.
Do you want another card? Type 'yes' or 'no': no
Your final hand: [11, 7], final score: 18.
Dealer's final hand: [10, 6, 7], final score: 16.
You win!

#Test the second time:
Your card is [8, 9], your score is 17.
Dealer's first card is 6.
Do you want another card? Type 'yes' or 'no': yes
Your card is [8, 9, 7], your score is 24.
Dealer's first card is 6.
Your final hand: [8, 9, 7], final score: 24.
Dealer's final hand: [6, 10, 8], final score: 16.
Your score is over 21, you lose!
