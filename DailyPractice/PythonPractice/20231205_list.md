# List
**Excercise: Password Generator Project**  
1. Define three lists, each of them consist of letters, symbols and numbers.
2. Ask for the users how many letters, numbers and symbols would they like in their passwords.
3. According to the input of the users, generate strong password for them, the order of the letters, symbols and numbers should be random.

**The code is:**

```py
import random
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z']
numbers = ['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9']
symbols = ['!', '#', '$', '%', '&', '(', ')', '*', '+']

num_letters = int(input("How many letters would you like in your password?\n"))
num_numbers = int(input("How many numbers would you like in your password?\n"))
num_symbols = int(input("How many symbols would you like in your password?\n")) #The type of the input is a string, so we need to convert it to an integer.

password_list = [] #Define a list to store the number of letters, symbols and numbers the users want.
for letter in range(num_letters):
    password_list.append(random.choice(letters))
for number in range(num_numbers):
    password_list.append(random.choice(numbers))
for symbol in range(num_symbols):
    password_list.append(random.choice(symbols)) #According to the input expected numbers of letters, numbers and symbols in password, using the "random.choice" function to select elements in the givin lists randomly, and using the "append" function to add them in the password list.

random.shuffle(password_list) #Reorder the password list randomly.
print(password_list) #But what we want to print is a password, we can't just print a list form, so we should define a new variable to store the actual password.
password = ""
for content in password_list:
    password += content
print(f"Your password is '{password}'.")
```
**Run the code:**

```py
How many letters would you like in your password?
4
How many numbers would you like in your password?
3
How many symbols would you like in your password?
2
['#', '%', '6', 'Q', '1', '9', 'R', 'o', 'g']
Your password is '#%6Q19Rog'.
```
# Using Dictionary to Complete the Exercise (Updated in 15/12/2023)

**The code is :**
```py
import random
#Define a dictionary to store the character types and lists:
character = {
    "letters": ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z'],
    "numbers": ['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'],
    "symbols": ['!', '#', '$', '%', '&', '(', ')', '*', '+'],
}

num_letters = int(input("How many letters would you like in your password?\n"))
num_numbers = int(input("How many numbers would you like in your password?\n"))
num_symbols = int(input("How many symbols would you like in your password?\n"))

password_list = []
for letter in range(num_letters):
    password_list.append(random.choice(character["letters"]))
for number in range(num_numbers):
    password_list.append(random.choice(character["numbers"]))
for symbol in range(num_symbols):
    password_list.append(random.choice(character["symbols"]))

random.shuffle(password_list)
password = ""
for content in password_list:
    password += content
print(f"Your password is '{password}'.")
```

**Test the code:**
```py
How many letters would you like in your password?
2
How many numbers would you like in your password?
2
How many symbols would you like in your password?
2
Your password is 'f#90!y'.
```

_**There is a simpler way to present the code, usint the build-in function `item()` and `local()`:**_
```py
import random
#Define a dictionary to store the character types and lists:
character = {
    "letters": ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z'],
    "numbers": ['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'],
    "symbols": ['!', '#', '$', '%', '&', '(', ')', '*', '+'],
}

num_letters = int(input("How many letters would you like in your password?\n"))
num_numbers = int(input("How many numbers would you like in your password?\n"))
num_symbols = int(input("How many symbols would you like in your password?\n"))
"""
character_types.items() returns a view object that displays a list of dictionary's key-value tuple pairs.
In the loop, char_type will represent the key (e.g., 'letters', 'numbers', 'symbols'), and char_list will represent the corresponding list of characters.
"""
password_list = []
for char_type, char_list in character.items():
    """
    locals() is a built-in function that returns a dictionary of the current local symbol table.
    f'num_{char_type}' is using an f-string to dynamically create the variable name based on the current char_type.
    So, for example, if char_type is 'letters', it will evaluate to num_letters, and if char_type is 'numbers', it will evaluate to num_numbers.
    This is a way to dynamically access the variables num_letters, num_numbers, and num_symbols based on the current character type in the loop.
    """
    for _ in range(locals()[f"num_{char_type}"]):
        password_list.append(random.choice(char_list))

random.shuffle(password_list)
password = "".join(password_list)
print(f"Your password is {password}.")
```

_**Test the code:**_
```py
How many letters would you like in your password?
2
How many numbers would you like in your password?
2
How many symbols would you like in your password?
2
Your password is Q6(B2+.
