# List and For Loop
**Exercise: Hangman**
1. Givin a word list, choose a word from the list randomly, print the chosen word as the test word, replace the letters in the word with `_` to show the users how many letters there are in the word,
2. Let the users guess the letters in the word, one letter each time,
3. If the guess letter is included in the word, replace the `_` with the guess letter, and continue the next round,
4. If users guess the wrong letter, the hang man will lose a life(The hangman picture will be givin in the code), there are in total 6 lives,
5. If the total 6 lives runs out, game over.

**The code is:**
```py
import random
