## Flight Deal Finder

1. This project is to find the cheapest flight ticket from one location to another from now to 6 months later.
2. Use Google Sheet to list all cities to which we want to find the ticket, after the cheapest flight information is found, record the price to the Google Sheet, and send message to the user.
3. The API used in this project: [Sheety: Google Sheet Data Management](https://sheety.co/), [Kiwi Partners Flight Search API](https://partners.kiwi.com/), [Tequila Flight Search API Documentation](https://tequila.kiwi.com/portal/docs/tequila_api), [Twilio SMS API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms).

## What Will be Made in the End


## Steps

1. Create a Google Sheet which later can add flights information to it. Edit the names of cities in the spreadsheet, check flights information later. The `IATA Code` is **International Air Transport Association** code, this is a three-letter code assigned to airport around the world, These codes are used for airline ticketing, flight planning, and baggage handling. They provide a standardized way to identify airports globally. But a city can have multiple airports, here I will only collect the city code not the airport code.
