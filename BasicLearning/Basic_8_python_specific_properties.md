## Python List vs Tuple

**Python List**

List in python is like array in other programming language like C, C++ and Java, but more flexible. It's an ordered collection of objects enclosed be square brackets and separated by commas, objects in a list can be arbitrary mixture of elements like numbers, strings or a nested list and so on. All elements in a list can be access by indexing, a list can be shrunk or grow, it's mutable.

Example of list:
```py
# An empty list:
empty_list = []

# A list of numbers:
num = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# A list of strings:
str = ["one", "two", "three", "four"]

# A list of mixture of numbers and strings:
mix = [1, 2, "one", "two"]

# A list of nested list:
nested_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, ["one", "two", "three", "four"]]
```

**Tuple**
