# Class

## What is Class in Python?

There are list, dictionary in python we use to organise data, class provides a means of bundling data and funtionality together. In python class is a code template to create objects. 

For example, a school needs to collect all the personal information of all freshmen, the first thing to do is to create an information spreadsheet template. The student's attributes like student name, student ID, gender, nationality, telephone number ect., maybe included in the template, when the new semester begins, the school will prepare the spreadsheets to give out to the freshmen, when students receive the information spreadsheet, they will fill out with their own information. After finishing collecting information of all freshmen, school can use these information to manage all the students.

This process just exactly like how `class` works in python. Creating the information spreadhseet template is like calling the function `class` to define a class, the attributes like student name, student ID, gender, nationality, telephone number ect. is called `member variables`, this is also the constructor of class. Giving every student a spreasheet is called creating objects, also called instance in python, and filling out the information is called assigning attributes to the objects, we can define some functions to access and process the collected data, these functionalities is call `member methods`.

By using `class` in python, we can organise and structure data in a single unit, reduce duplication.
