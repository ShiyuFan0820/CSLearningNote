# Hash Map

## Definition of Hash Map

We know that McDonald's hash browns, which are made with a lot of shredded potatoes, eventually become a evenly distributed pie shape. The principle of Hash Table also known as Hash Map is similar to this one. 

Hash Map or Hash Table, it's a data structure that stores key-value pairs, it uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found based on its associated key, allowing for efficient retrieval, insertion and deletion of values based on their keys, the hash function helps distribute keys and values evenly across the available storage space, optimize the access efficiency.
